# Got Pro 

A simple app to conduct bulk downloads from your GoPro Hero 4's wifi network

## General Plan

1. grab the contents of index.html from the GoPro server

1. parse the index.html file content to extract directory and file info

1. Provide a set of links that allow directory-level downloads

1. Create a dynamic directory route that packages up all the files in a directory into a .zip file and then returns the .zip file as a response for saving to the local computer.
