A simple app to conduct bulk downloads from your GoPro Hero 4's wifi network

** General Plan **

# grab the contents of index.html from the GoPro server

# parse the index.html file content to extract directory and file info

# Provide a set of links that allow directory-level downloads

# Create a dynamic directory route that packages up all the files in a directory into a .zip file and then returns the .zip file as a response for saving to the local computer.
